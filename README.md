# Simple Python Compiler üêçüíª‚ú®

## Introduction üëã

You know how sometimes you just wanna quickly test out some code without setting up a whole environment? That's exactly what inspired me to build this little project, "Simple Python Compiler". It's a simple web-based tool where you can write and run Python code right in your browser. I used the awesome CodeMirror editor for a smooth coding experience and hooked it up to an external API to handle the code execution. It's been a fun project to work on, and I hope you find it useful! üòä

## Live Demo üöÄ

You can check out a live version of the project here:

## Demo Video üé¨

Currently, there isn't a demo video available. I'm planning to add one soon to walk you through how to use the "Simple Python Compiler"! Stay tuned! üòâ

## Features ‚ú®

- üìù **Code Editing:** Write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code with syntax highlighting and other cool features thanks to CodeMirror 6.65.7.
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Code Execution:** Run your code using the powerful Piston API from `emkc.org`.
- üìÅ **Simple Structure:** Easy to understand and navigate with just `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
- üåê **Web-Based:** Access and use the Compilerr directly in your web browser.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **HTML:** The basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling to make things look good.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For handling the editor logic, API calls, and user interactions.
- **CodeMirror 6.65.7:** A versatile code editor library for the browser.
- **Piston API (`emkc.org/api/v2/piston/execute`):** Used for executing the code written in the editor.

## Getting Started üöÄ
