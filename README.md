# Simple Python Compiler 🐍💻✨

## Introduction 👋

You know how sometimes you just wanna quickly test out some code without setting up a whole environment? That's exactly what inspired me to build this little project, "Simple Python Compiler". It's a simple web-based tool where you can write and run Python code right in your browser. I used the awesome CodeMirror editor for a smooth coding experience and hooked it up to an external API to handle the code execution. It's been a fun project to work on, and I hope you find it useful! 😊

## Live Demo 🚀

You can check out a live version of the project here:

## Demo Video 🎬

Currently, there isn't a demo video available. I'm planning to add one soon to walk you through how to use the "Simple Python Compiler"! Stay tuned! 😉

## Features ✨

* 📝 **Code Editing:** Write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code with syntax highlighting and other cool features thanks to CodeMirror 6.65.7.
* ▶️ **Code Execution:** Run your code using the powerful Piston API from `emkc.org`.
* 📁 **Simple Structure:** Easy to understand and navigate with just `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
* 🌐 **Web-Based:** Access and use the Compilerr directly in your web browser.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

* **HTML:** The basic structure of the web page.
* **CSS:** Styling to make things look good.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For handling the editor logic, API calls, and user interactions.
* **CodeMirror 6.65.7:** A versatile code editor library for the browser.
* **Piston API (`emkc.org/api/v2/piston/execute`):** Used for executing the code written in the editor.
